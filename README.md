# LeetCode adventures

## Main principles 

1. Order matters
1. language somewhat matters (will use C++ to understand DS then use Python to solve problems)
1. 45mins - 1 hour max per question
1. Must explain reasoning when working
1. Solve 1-2 questions per day
1. Realize that at times only the solution (or God) will be able to help me with some questions
1. Note down tricks to solve questions
1. To ensure that I have grasped concepts:
    + Review solved questions
    + Review tricks to solve questions

## Roadmap (from [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/roadmap))
![roadmap](roadmap.png)

## LeetCode problems solved:
### Arrays and Hashing
Easy
- [x] Two Sum
- [x] Contains duplicate
- [x] Valid anagram

Medium
- [x] Group anagrams
- [x] Top K frequent elements
- [x] Product of array except self
- [ ] Encode and decode strings
- [ ] Longest consecutive sequence


## Data structures covered so far:
- [x] Arrays
- [X] Hash maps
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] LinkedList
- [ ] Trees
    - [ ] Tries
- [ ] Graphs
- [ ] Advanced graphs?


## Algorithms/techniques covered so far ft. (associated LeetCode problems):
- Multiple hashmaps to find anagrams
- Modified bucket sort to solve (347) frequent k elements
    - Positions mean number of occurences of elements
    - Arrays containing said element are stored instead of character count
    -Traversed backwards instead of forwards
